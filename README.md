Aivition is an all-in-one image processing tool. It's lightweight, launches quickly, and lets you view images instantly or browse large collections in a smooth, cascading layout. It also features an infinite canvas, allowing you to freely arrange and organize images just like on your desktop. When you're ready to edit, simply right-click an image to bring up a menu of options—from basic cropping and rotating to AI-powered features like background removal, HD upscaling, and face swapping.
